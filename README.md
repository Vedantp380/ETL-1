# Financial Data Analysis Pipeline

This repository contains code for an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline and analysis of financial data using PySpark and MySQL.

## Overview

The project consists of two main parts:
1. **ETL Pipeline**: Reads financial data from a MySQL database, performs transformations and analysis using PySpark, and saves the results to CSV files.
2. **Data Analysis**: Uses SQL queries to analyze the financial data and generate insights such as revenue trends, expense analysis, profit margins, and product performance.

## File Structure

- `etl_pipeline.py`: Python script for the ETL pipeline.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required for the project.

## Setup

1. Install the required Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Update the JDBC URL, database credentials, and S3 bucket path in `etl_pipeline.py` with your own.
3. Run the `etl_pipeline.py` script to perform the ETL process and save the analysis results.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git`
2. Navigate to the repository: `cd your_repository`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Update the JDBC URL, database credentials, and S3 bucket path in `etl_pipeline.py`.
5. Run the ETL pipeline: `python etl_pipeline.py`
6. View the analysis results in the generated CSV files in your S3 bucket.
